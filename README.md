Note: This project is a work in progress.

This is a web application designed to make the stock market more accessible to beginners. Inspired by platforms like Yahoo Finance or MarketWatch, this app simplifies financial data and introduces essential terminology, concepts, and institutions.

Unlike traditional finance platforms that assume prior knowledge, this app includes:
- Explanations of financial terminology (e.g., EBITDA, EPS, P/E ratio)
- Contextual tooltips to help users understand what the data means
    Educational content on:
    - How the stock market works
    - Roles of institutions (e.g., SEC, exchanges, central banks)
    - Market regulations and investor protections

Frontend: React, TypeScript
API Data: Financial Modeling Prep API (or other data providers)
Requires a (free) API key from https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/
